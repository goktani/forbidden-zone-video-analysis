# forbidden-zone-video-analysis
This project detects objects and tracks people entering a predefined forbidden zone in videos using YOLOv8 segmentation. It is implemented in three versions:  1) `segment_forbidden_overlay.py` - Applies segmentation and overlays the forbidden zone.  2) `segment_forbidden_overlay_tracking.py` - Adds multi-object tracking and saves processed outputs in the `processed_videos` folder.  3) `segment_forbidden_overlay_trackingv2.py` - Final optimized version allowing the forbidden zone to be selected before each video, with outputs saved in the `processed_videosv2` folder. The project supports GPU acceleration on MacBook M1 using Metal Performance Shaders (MPS).
